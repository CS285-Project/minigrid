experimental-code:
    Draft code, not really used

rl-starter-files:
    Cloned from the original repository, and I modified to include a GPT interface.
    I also wrote a GPT-based reward shaping function to ask GPT about the reward.

Setting up the repository:
    After creating your conda environment:
    `cd rl-starter-files`
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
